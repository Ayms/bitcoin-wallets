bitcoin-wallets
===

Bitcoin (BTC, BCH, BTG, etc) and [Zcash](https://github.com/Ayms/zcash-wallets) wallets made simple, javascript implementation of [BIP 32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) Bitcoin hierarchical deterministic keys

## Rationale

Create your bitcoin addresses and wallets by your own and recover them from a phrase (but please read the warning below)/seed you know if you lose them, this eliminates the constant need of wallets backup with the associated risks and this eliminates the risk of losing all of your addresses (then your money)

Convert your original bitcoin address to a bitcoin fork address (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, etc)

## Conversion

Given the increasing number of forks that are occurring this module allows non expert users to easily match addresses from their original wallet to a bitcoin fork address (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, etc), so you don't need to regenerate one wallet for each fork

## Implementation

This module is using [elliptic](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic) and [bs58](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/bs58), the code is inspired from [hdkey](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/hdkey)

## Details

There are quasi no standards for bitcoin wallets, every bitcoin client proposes a specific one and generally does not let you generate your keys, the reason invoked for this is to protect the users from generating insecure keys that could be discovered and stolen by an attacker

[Bitcoin core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) has recently implemented as the default partially [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8035) which generates first 100 addresses from a seed chosen by the software

We don't think that it's necessarily a good idea to trust a software, even open source, to choose the main seed for you knowing that all of your keys depend on it and are generated from this master seed (which is typically a 32 bytes sequence)

This implementation is mainly following the bitcoin core wallet format but lets you decide for the seed, you can reuse the information generated for other wallets, you can select from the addresses generated which ones you will use and break the tree dependencies

## Can we trust BIP32?

There are good signs that we can but of course if all your addresses depend on a tree algorithm then, even if unlikely, the possibility still exists to revert it and discover the seed from your keys, then discover all of your keys. Another possibility, probably unlikely also, is to find patterns allowing to fingerprint all the keys generated so finally people can trace you.

Surprisingly from ~32 bytes keys BIP32 ends up with a 78 bytes format to describe them with all the necessary information like indexes, parent to possibly allow to revert the tree

Bitcoin core derives two addresses from a seed and then derives all the other addresses from it, this constitute one branch in the tree and the (hardened) addresses are represented by m/0/i where i is the number of the key, when 100 addresses are used it generates others following the same principle

bitcoin-wallets do the same but introduces a secret option where the reference to the tree for each key is not indicated in the wallet, neither the master seed and master key (so you should better make sure you will be able to recover it if you use this option)

## Warning

For now you should not use this module (except for conversion purposes) if you are not an expert to choose a seed with enough entropy (ie 128 bits) and you should not use the possibility to derive keys from a phrase

Indeed, human phrases are known to be predictable with considerably less (ie ridiculous) entropy than a seed generated with a prng

Do not think you are stronger than the theory and will generate a human phrase with 128 bits of entropy, you won't

Other methods exist to remember more easily your seed than a 32 bytes sequence, for example [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) or [Electrum](http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/seedphrase.html)

But choosing x words among a set of y words in a dictionary to reach the required entropy is still not something a human being will easily remember, it will have to be written somewhere, so we can question why it can be considered easier than writing a 32 bytes sequence, question of appreciation, people like it apparently

This is an ongoing TODO but one of the goals here would be to generate a seed from phrases/information that a human being can really remember, more to come...

## Installation

Just create a folder, copy index.js and install via npm [elliptic](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic) and [bs58](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/bs58)

## Use - Generate wallets
	
Output is stored in wallet.txt, all details for the keys are stored in log.txt (recommended to backup somewhere)

	Bitcoin Core

	create_wallet(new Buffer('4ecf2e71d567072fe2f9cda40873afcaae4224e3f249018621a90dd43e88f8de','hex')); //see /tests/wallet.txt and compare with original_wallet_dump.txt

	create_wallet(new Buffer('4ecf2e71d567072fe2f9cda40873afcaae4224e3f249018621a90dd43e88f8de','hex'),true); //see /tests/wallet_secret.txt

## Use - Convert bitcoin addresses

Convert an address from your original bitcoin wallet (private key in WIF format) to a bitcoin fork address

	Bitcoin Cash
	
	convert('KxDohMDu4iQ3GYMJGakyfCtcHtuGjqfcDLR2oUYEbNpkGJeTYmGq',new Buffer('00','hex'),new Buffer('1c','hex'));
	
	BTC address 16uqY2xbpWc2h3aJMiYc2PKs17f4NyQ8GY converted to CNNj75JfhZaZbBUj3TsXbtwtdEsUGaQ6qi
	
	Bitcoin Gold
	
	convert('KxDohMDu4iQ3GYMJGakyfCtcHtuGjqfcDLR2oUYEbNpkGJeTYmGq',new Buffer('00','hex'),new Buffer('26','hex'));
	
	BTC address 16uqY2xbpWc2h3aJMiYc2PKs17f4NyQ8GY converted to GPkkxAHYoNDKmWsbHfCiT9fkvHSuShfFcc
	
	Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin Gold
	
	convert('KxDohMDu4iQ3GYMJGakyfCtcHtuGjqfcDLR2oUYEbNpkGJeTYmGq',new Buffer('1c','hex'),new Buffer('26','hex'));
	
	BTC address CNNj75JfhZaZbBUj3TsXbtwtdEsUGaQ6qi converted to GPkkxAHYoNDKmWsbHfCiT9fkvHSuShfFcc
	
	
The input is your private key in WIF format (KxDohMDu4iQ3GYMJGakyfCtcHtuGjqfcDLR2oUYEbNpkGJeTYmGq here) in your wallet.dat dump, check anyway that the convert output gives the right corresponding original bitcoin address (16uqY2xbpWc2h3aJMiYc2PKs17f4NyQ8GY in the above example)
	
## Wallets import/export

In bitcoin core, open the debug console (Help/Debug console)
	
To dump your current wallet use ``dumpwallet wallet.txt``

Note: hdmaster, renamed hdseed here, is your master seed, see the Tools below if you want to get its hex representation

To import your bitcoin-wallets, put your wallet.txt in the bitcoin core root directory and use ``importwallet wallet.txt``

Again you can choose among the keys generated by bitcoin-wallets those that you want to put in your final wallet.txt (that's why you should better keep log.txt if you want later to reconciliate the keys chosen with the tree)

Currently importing keys as described above does not remove previous keys, [request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8684) made to the bitcoin core team which is apparently implementing too a way to create keys from a user chosen private key/seed - watch [Wallet - add option for a custom extended master privat key (xpriv)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8735)

## Other formats

The default bitcoin client version is bitcoin core (then compressed format is used for public keys and address derivation, 01 is added to private keys representation), please feel free to post bug/PR and/or contact us for other versions

## Tools

See various uses and tools in tests/tests.js (a bit messy, yes, but useful)
